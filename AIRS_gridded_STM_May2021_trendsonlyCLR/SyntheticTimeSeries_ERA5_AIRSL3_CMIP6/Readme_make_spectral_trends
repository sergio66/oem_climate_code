  SyntheticTimeSeries_ERA5_AIRSL3_CMIP6/plot_check_WV_T_RH_CMIP6_geo_and_spectral_rates2.m is common to all these

The "sergio_matlab_jobB.sbatch: can be used nicely eg 
  "5"  for making the ip/op/rp rtp file with the monthly ERA5 data
  "12" for reading the .rp.rtp file and making spectral trends

Then FIND_NWP_MODEL_TRENDS/driver_get_the_model_trends.m can be used to plot the spectral trends
