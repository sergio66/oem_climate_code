In the submitted paper we used the ERA-Interim profiles for
temperature, water vapor, and ozone to generate the anomaly Jacobians.
Note that we did update the CO2, N2O, and CH4 amounts when computing
the Jacobians for each time step.  

Reviewer X asked a reasonable
question: are the ERA-Interim T/H2O/O3 profiles accurate enough to use
as the atmospheric state for each time step when computing Jacobians.
To address this we retrieved the atmospheric state directly from tropical
averaged radiance values (not the anomalies) once per year 
over the anomaly time period.  

This retrieval used essentially the same algorithm for the anomaly
retrievals, except that the a-priori profiles for T/H2O/O3 were the
tropical averaged ERA-Interim values; as is the case for the anomaly
retrievals, CO2 was initialized with a (linearly) time varying
value. Typically the retrieved values for T/WV/O3 differed from the
ERA-Interim values (the a-priori) by 0.05 K/20%/5% in the lower
troposphere for T(z),WV(z) and UT/LS for O3(z) respectively.  Perhaps
the T(z) was constrained a little too tightly, but we have been
reliable informed by the AIRS/CRIS retrieval teams that NWP models
have excellent T(z) model fields; conversely since WV and O3 are
highly variable, we are not surprised by those larger changes.

We then computed the anomaly Jacobians using the retrieved state
rather than using the ERA-Interim state, and found that on average the
(column) T/H2O/O3 Jacobians changed by 0.01 K/K / 0.6 K/log(colum q)
/0.02 K/log(colum q) on average, or in terms of percent values in the
peak of sounding region 2/ 10 /0.3.

Of more interest is how the trace gas jacobians change due to the
above mentioned T/WV changes. The percent column jacobian changes for
CO2/N2O/CH4 were on the order of 1/1/0.5 respectively. These are small
changes, and when these deltas were brute force applied to all the 365
sixteen-day time steps in our anomaly retrievals, the final CO2, N2O,
and CH4 trends only changed by -0.01 ppm/yr/ -0.014 ppm/yr / 0.07
ppb/yr, change that are small enough to not impact our AIRS trend
uncertainty measurements.
